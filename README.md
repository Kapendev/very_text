# *very_text*

A blazing fast and memory safe `DrawText` library for raylib and the [ODIN programming language](https://dlang.org/)..............

The library is now production-ready!

## Why very_text 👉👈

* Minimalistic: Avoids abstractions
* Focused: Doesn't try to support every use case
* Simple: Uses a single global allocator, set at compile time
* Friendly: Memory-safety features and many examples

## WebAssembly Support OwO

WebAssembly is supported.

## Documentation -.-

To test if the library works, run:

```
odin run .
```

Replace `when true` with `when false` to use the library as a library.

## Patreon!!

I am working on it.
