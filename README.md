# very_text

A blazing fast and memory safe `DrawText` library for raylib and the [ODIN programming language](https://dlang.org/)..............

## Why very_text 👉👈

* Minimalistic: Avoids abstractions
* Focused: Doesn't try to support every use case
* Simple: Uses a single global allocator, set at compile time
* Friendly: Memory-safety features and many examples

## WebAssembly Support

WebAssembly is supported.

## Documentation

To test if the library works, run:

```
odin run .
```

Replace `when true` with `when false` to use the library as a library.

## Patreon

I am working on it.
